=== 3.2.0 / 2010-10-12
* Last release broke 1.8 compatibility due to use of strptime. 1.8 and 1.9
both work in 3.2.0.
* Moved Pidgin2Adium::VERSION to its own file

=== 3.1.1 / 2010-08-13
* Moved BasicParser and its subclasses into parsers/ subdir
  - You can now do "require 'pidgin2adium/parsers/all'",
    though the old "require 'pidgin2adium/log_parser" will still work
* Moved Message and its subclasses into messages/ subdir
  - You can now do "require 'pidgin2adium/messages/all'",
    though the old "require 'pidgin2adium/message" will still work
=== 3.1.0 / 2010-08-13
* Compatible with Ruby 1.9!
  - removed dependency on "parsedate" library, which 1.9 doesn't have
* log_parser.rb has been split into separate files (1 per class, more or less)
  - "require pidgin2adium/log_parser" will still pull in all of the split-up
    classes
* balance_tags_c extension really does work now
* Cleans up more junk from Pidgin logfiles when parsing
* Bugfixes and more graceful handling of error states
* Fully tested (except bin/pidgin2adium, which remains tricky)

=== 3.0.1 / 2010-08-07
Bugfix release:
* balance_tags_c.c: Use rb_eval_string instead of rb_reg_regcomp to avoid
  segfaults (commit #733ce88b0836256e14f0, fixes #27811)
Non-user-facing stuff:
* Switched to Jeweler, RSpec, and Bundler
* Rakefile now doesn't choke if Hanna gem isn't installed

=== 3.0.0 / 2010-01-31
* balance_tags.rb is now a C extension (Pidgin2Adium.balance_tags_c)
  - the pure-ruby mixin balance_tags (without the trailing "_c") is gone
* Better handling of command-line arguments
* Format time zones offsets correctly (e.g. "+0500", not "+-0500")
* Write Yahoo! and Jabber logs to correct directories (#27710)
* Better matching of regexes against time strings
* Better documentation

=== 2.0.2 / 2009-12-18
* Much better documentation (more of it, and higher quality too!)
* Allow user-provided output dir at commandline
* Cleaner error messages
* require 'time' for Time.zone_offset (fixes bug)
* Gracefully handle lack of timezone info
* Gracefully handle nonexistent output dir
* Gracefully handle parsing errors
* Print error messages during *and* after batch converting so they're actually seen

=== 2.0.1 / 2009-12-06
* Fix timestamps so they show up in Adium chat log viewer

=== 2.0.0 / 2009-11-24
* Added documentation, available at http://pidgin2adium.rubyforge.org/rdoc/
* Added public interface for scripting purposes
* Removed -o and -l options. Now gem automatically outputs to Adium log dir with no intermediate folder.

=== 1.0.0 / 2009-09-27
* Birthday!
